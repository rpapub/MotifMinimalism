# Core Constructs of Software Runtime

Every software system, regardless of language, paradigm, or domain, relies on a minimal set of fundamental execution semantics or runtime constructs. These constructs define how logic executes, how data and control flow through a system, and how behavior is coordinated during runtime. Whether designing a programming language, workflow engine, or automation platform, support for these constructs is essential. While distinct, they operate in relation to one another and map to recurring phases of execution, from initialization and invocation to flow control, error handling, and eventual completion, reflecting both their universality and runtime ordering.

- **Configuration** External inputs and environment settings before runtime begins.

- **Invocation & Composition** Execution of logic units and how they are combined.

- **Parameter Passing** How runtime inputs are supplied to executable units.

- **Flow Control** Directs execution paths: sequencing, branching, loops, concurrency.

- **Error Handling** Runtime response to faults and exceptional conditions.

- **Event Handling** Reactivity and asynchronous interaction at runtime.

- **Typing & Validation** Enforces correctness before or at the point of execution.

- **State & Memory** Runtime storage, context, and mutability.

These runtime constructs rarely appear in isolation. In most systems, they are composed, layered, or intertwined. Configuration influences parameter passing, invocation triggers flow control, and state changes may propagate through event handling. Understanding these constructs individually provides a foundation, but their value lies in how they work together to shape execution across diverse technologies.
