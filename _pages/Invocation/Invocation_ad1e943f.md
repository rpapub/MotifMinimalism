# Invocation and Parameter Passing

This folder presents an as-code representation of a core runtime construct: passing input into a trigger at the point of invocation. It includes three focused cases—passing a simple string, a complex JSON object, and both together—to capture how input handling behaves across varying levels of complexity. These examples serve to validate the construct’s execution semantics across the platform.
