## Be active for the community!

Contributions are welcome to improve the quality and coverage of the solution library.

### Contribution types:

* Reporting documentation errors or inconsistencies
* Submitting new solution examples aligned with the library structure and purpose

All contributions are submitted via **GitHub Issues**:
→ [Submit documentation correction](https://github.com/rpapub/MotifMinimalism/issues/new?template=documentation-improvement.yml)

For questions, clarifications, or structural discussions, use the GitHub Discussions board:
→ [MotifMinimalism General Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/rpapub/discussions/categories/motifminimalism-general)

### Contributor Recognition

For each author submitting accepted solution examples, a dedicated author profile page is generated automatically. This page includes the contributor’s name and a list of published examples associated with their authorship metadata.

Contributions are reviewed for alignment with project structure: reusable, typed, and platform-aware automation assets. Submissions must meet baseline documentation and naming expectations.
