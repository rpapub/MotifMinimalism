In the fast-paced world of automation and low-code development, there is one quiet practice that consistently unlocks clarity, learning, and reuse: the **Minimal, Complete, Verifiable Example**, or MCVE.

## What is an MCVE?

An MCVE is not just a snippet or a screenshot. It is a **small, self-contained code artifact** that faithfully reproduces a behavior, bug, or pattern. It is minimal (no noise), complete (no missing parts), and verifiable (it actually runs). This structure enables others to **understand, validate, and improve** your work without guessing what is missing.

## Why It Matters in Low-Code

Low-code environments often emphasize **speed over clarity**. But without structure, examples become brittle or unusable across teams. This is where MCVEs shine:

* They **reveal the actual input/output shape**, not just screenshots
* They expose **flow control and typing decisions**, which are essential for reuse
* They make behaviors **repeatable and testable**, especially in debugging or documentation

In automation, clarity is productivity. A working example beats a thousand words and invites better questions, stronger patterns, and faster iteration.

<!--## Silent Pattern Sharing

MCVEs serve a dual role:

1. **As artifacts**: They live in `minimals/`, alongside patterns and schemas, validating that a pattern works across inputs
2. **As tutorials**: Each MCVE can become a teaching unit in our MkDocs site, tagged by flow type, runtime construct, or pattern phase (for example, Initialization, Invocation)

This reinforces **developer-centered knowledge** without preaching. The example speaks. Others adapt.

## What Makes a Good MCVE?

| Principle  | Criteria                                              |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Minimal    | Only contains logic relevant to the behavior          |
| Complete   | Runs without external setup or missing dependencies   |
| Verifiable | Can be executed and produce a result or error clearly |

Each MCVE follows a simple structure:

* A clearly named folder (for example, `parameter-passing/01-simple-string`)
* Input/output examples (`input.json`, `output.json`)
* Optional `README.md` with metadata
* Minimal code or workflow file (for example, `.xaml`, `.cs`, or `.py`)

## Real-World Impact

MCVEs reduce friction. Instead of asking:

> Why does my automation not send the email?

you can provide:

> Here is a minimal `.xaml` that shows the problem when `in_to` is null.

Now, you are enabling understanding, not just asking for help.

## Try this

* When answering a question, **build an MCVE**
* When documenting a reusable pattern, **include an MCVE**
* As a team, start your debugging with **What is the MCVE?**
